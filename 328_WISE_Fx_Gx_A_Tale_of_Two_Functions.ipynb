    "If there are **N** light bulbs, each with a brightness of **W** watts, then the total brightness, **T** of all these bulbs is just **N** x **W**. For $N = 3$ bulbs and $W = 100$ watts, we have $T = 300$ watts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $N(m)$ tells us the number of stars in an area of the sky with a brightness of **m**. Let a second function, $S(m)$, represent the number of watts per square meter at the Earth that a star with a brightness of **m** produces. Then $N(m) S(m)$ will be the total number of \\frac{watts}{meter^2} produced by the stars in the sample that have a brightness of **m**.\n",

    "NASA's Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite is surveying the sky to catalog stars visible at a wavelength of **3.5 microns** in the infrared spectrum. If the differential star count function $N(m) = 0.000005m$ x $m^7$ stars, and the star brightness function is defined by $S(m) = 350$ x $10^{0.4}m$ Janskys.
