    "If **0%** represents black and **100%** represents white, the smallest intensity in the image (**1%**) will correspond to **100 cents**; but the stars represent a contrast change of **0.5%** or **50 cents**, which is smaller than the **100 cents (1%)** contrast that the image can register on this camera setting.\n",
