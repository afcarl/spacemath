    "# A Timeline for Planet Formation\n",
    "\n",
    "For decades, geologists and astronomers have studied the contents of our solar system. They have compared surface features on planets and moons across the solar system, the orbits of asteroids and comets, and the chemical composition and ages for recovered meteorites. From all this effort, and with constant checking of data against mathematical models, scientists have created a timeline for the formation of our solar system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solar system began as a collapsing cloud of gas and dust over 4.6 billion years ago. Over the next 600 million years, called by geologists the [Hadean Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadean), the sun and the planets were formed and Earth's oceans were probably created by cometary impacts. Comets are very rich in water ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fossil record on Earth shows that the first bacterial lifeforms emerged around 600 million years after the formation of the solar system. Geologists call this the [Archean Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean) - the era of ancient life.\n",
