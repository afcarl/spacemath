    "A small, dense object only twelve miles in diameter is responsible for this beautiful X-ray nebula that spans 150 light years and resembles a human hand! At the center of this image made by NASA's [Chandra X-ray Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandra_X-ray_Observatory) is a very young and powerful pulsar known as [PSR B1509-58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1509-58).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **pulsar** is a rapidly spinning neutron star which is spewing energy out into the space around it to create complex and intriguing structures, including this one that resembles a large, cosmic hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Astronomers think that the pulsar and its nebula are about 1,700 years old, and are located about **17.000 light years away** (e.g., **5,000 parsecs**). Finger-like structures extend to the north, apparently energizing knots of material in a neighboring gas cloud known as [RCW-89](http://galaxymap.org/cat/view/rcw/89). The transfer of energy from the wind to these knots makes them glow brightly in X-rays (orange and red features to the upper right).\n",
