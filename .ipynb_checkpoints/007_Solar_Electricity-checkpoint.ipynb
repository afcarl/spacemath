    "Most satellites depend on sunlight converted into electricity and stored in batteries, to run their instruments. Typical research satellites operate with only **200 to 800 watts** of electricity generated by sunlight and _solar cells_. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Solar cells_ can be attached directly to the outer surface of a satellite, or can be found on _solar panels_ that the satellite deploys after it reaches its orbit. Engineers decide how many solar cells are needed by finding out how much power the satellite needs to operate, and then figuring out what the satellite's surface area is. If the satellite is not big enough, additional solar panels may be needed to supply the electricity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will calculate the perimeter of the satellite, in centimeters, and the area, in square centimeters, of several kinds of satellite surfaces. You will then decide if there is enough available surface to supply the electrical needs of the satellite. \n",
