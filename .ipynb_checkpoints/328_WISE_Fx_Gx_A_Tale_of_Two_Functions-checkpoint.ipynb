    "If there are **N** light bulbs, each with a brightness of **W** watts, then the total brightness, **T** of all these bulbs is just **N** x **W**. For $N = 3$ bulbs and $W = 100$ watts, we have $T = 300$ watts.\n",

    "Suppose $N(m)$ tells us the number of stars in an area of the sky with a brightness of **m**. Let a second function, $S(m)$, represent the number of watts per square meter at the Earth that a star with a brightness of **m** produces. Then $N(m) S(m)$ will be the total number of \\frac{watts}{meter^2} produced by the stars in the sample that have a brightness of **m**.\n",
